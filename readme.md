# opencode-fixtodo

This plugin does two things to fix the todo tool system for more utility, either of
which can be disabled in settings:

1. Restores the `todoread` tool.
2. Appends the current todo list to the ends of compaction messages.

Hopefully this will be a durable solution. If AnomalyCo ever decides to rip out the
`todowrite` tool as well, I'll return to this project to fix that mistake as well.

## Status

Open issues can be tracked [here](https://github.com/k98kurz/opencode-fixtodo/issues).
Historical changes can be found in the
[changelog](https://github.com/k98kurz/opencode-fixtodo/blob/master/changelog.md).

## Usage

### Installation

Add the plugin to your `opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugin": ["opencode-fixtodo"]
}
```

A local checkout works too: use the file path instead, e.g.
`"./path/to/fixtodo.ts"`.

### Configuration

Options are passed via the tuple form of the plugin entry (the options object
is scoped to the plugin, so keys are flat):

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugin": [
    ["opencode-fixtodo", { "compaction": false, "tool": true }]
  ]
}
```

| Option      | Default | Description                                                          |
| ----------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `compaction` | `true`  | Append the current todo list to compaction summary messages.         |
| `tool`       | `true`  | Register the `todoread` tool so the agent can read the todo list.    |

Both options default to `true`; omit either to keep the default. Config is
loaded at startup, so restart opencode after changing it.

### Testing

First, clone the repo, then install dependencies and run the tests:

```bash
npm install
npm test          # node --test
npm run typecheck # tsc --noEmit
```

Uses built-in `node:test` runner with Node.js >= 22.18; no external dependencies.

## Why This Exists

Earlier in 2026, AnomalyCo removed the `todoread` tool, which was a mistake that
they later justified by describing themselves as lemmings following other harness
devs over a cliff. In my experience, this led to noticeable and detrimental drift
during long tasks involving compactions, which I was using at the time regularly
to reduce hallucinations. Prior to this mistake-turned-policy, I had instructions
directing agents to read the todo list after every compaction, which helped keep
them on task during long runs. Performance substantially degraded after they
accidentally dropped the `todoread` tool and decided to hang everyone out to dry
with a post-hoc rationalization for an obvious mistake. (And of course, they said
that it wasn't a problem for them, so it couldn't possibly be a problem to everyone
complaining about it.)

After I noticed this degradation in agent performance and alignment, I first
looked through their issue tracker to discover a thin fork restoring the missing
tool (fadedcode). I used that for a while, but because it was not maintained to
port fixes, and because AnomalyCo kept changing their API server behaviors, it
eventually became unusable. My workaround for a while was to add instructions to
AGENTS.md to use a todo.md file, but then parallel agents clobbered each other
constantly, so I eventually decided to make this plugin.
